This folder contains the program (fmbuilder) for generating feature models from Android preference files. It also contains the res/xml/ folders of the prefest apps which we use as our subjects.
To generate the feature models corresponding to the apps, execute the provided shell script:
./buildFM.sh

The script writes all output to a directory named: output_XX where the _XX is an automated suffix generated by the script.
The output filder will contain, for each APP, the follwoing files:
APP.fam :- feature model in FAMILIAR syntax
APP.txt :- list of preferences in APP along with their preferene type (or Unsupported, if they are not supported by fmbuilder)
APP.xml :- feature model in SPLOT syntx
APP_count.txt :- number of valid configurations represented by the feature model, as counted by the FAMILIAR tool
APP_pref_stats.csv :- counts of the differt types of preferences in APP that fmbuilder was able to map to the feature model (used for answering RQ1)

# APKs
Each folder in this directory represents an application we tested and contains 6 files:
- ac.akp: "application clean", the clean version of the app;
- af.apk: "application framework", the version of the app augmented with the VATE framework;
- t1.apk, t2.apk, t3.apk, t4.apk: the four test scenarios.

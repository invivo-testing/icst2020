# VATE Server

This folder contains the in-vivo server for configuration management and testing purposes, although the testing part in not enabled because not applicable to the research question 2.

Before setting up the VATE server in this folder, you might want to use our deployed server at http://invivo.ml:8080/

This address is already encoded in the APKs of the 6 apps on which we ran the experiment.

If instead you need a local instance of the server, you just need to run the start-invivo-server.sh script:

```
./start-invivo-server.sh
```
